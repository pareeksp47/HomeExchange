====================================

The scope of the project is to provide a smart home management platform for the customers of Domisep through a website which will enable the users to associate sensors to their apartment, control the sensors installed at their apartment remotely and view the information provided by the sensors through a dashboard, manage secondary users, set up guidelines for their apartment and raise concerns/complaints through the customer help sectionHowever, the website does not handle any hardware/software issues of the installed sensors.
